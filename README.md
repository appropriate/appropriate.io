# Appropriate Computing, LLC

This repository contains the source code for Appropriate Computing's main website at http://appropriate.io.

## Colophon

This site uses a modified version of the [Freelancer](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-freelancer) theme, part of the Start Bootstrap library of themes. Start Bootstrap was created by and is maintained by **David Miller**, Managing Parter at [Iron Summit Media Strategies](http://www.ironsummitmedia.com/).

Start Bootstrap is based on the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework created by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thorton](https://twitter.com/fat). The Freelancer theme is based on [Bootswatch Flatly](https://bootswatch.com/flatly) by [Thomas Park](http://thomaspark.co/).

The customizations for this site include the use of Appropriate Computing's color scheme as well as a switch to the freely-available [Cabin](http://www.impallari.com/cabin) font by Pablo Impallari.
